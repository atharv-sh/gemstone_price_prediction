# Gemstone Price Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the price of gemstones based on their characteristics.

**Data**

The dataset contains information on 322,623 gemstones, including the following features:

* **carat:** Weight of the gemstone in carats.
* **cut:** Quality of the gemstone's cut (e.g., Ideal, Premium, Good).
* **color:** Color of the gemstone (e.g., D, E, F, G).
* **clarity:** Clarity of the gemstone (e.g., IF, VVS1, VVS2).
* **depth:** Percentage of the gemstone's height relative to its average diameter.
* **table:** Width of the gemstone's top relative to its widest point.
* **x:** Length of the gemstone in millimeters.
* **y:** Width of the gemstone in millimeters.
* **z:** Height of the gemstone in millimeters.
* **price:** Price of the gemstone in USD (target variable).

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

* Handle missing values in the `price` column (e.g., imputation, removal).
* Encode categorical features (cut, color, clarity) using appropriate techniques (e.g., one-hot encoding, ordinal encoding).
* Perform feature scaling (e.g., standardization, normalization) to improve model performance.

**Model Development**

* **Explore various machine learning models:**
    * Linear Regression
    * Decision Tree Regression
    * Random Forest Regression
    * Support Vector Regression
    * Gradient Boosting Machines
    * Neural Networks
* **Train and evaluate models:**
    * Split the data into training and testing sets.
    * Train the models on the training data.
    * Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
* **Hyperparameter tuning:** Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the best-performing models to optimize their performance.

**Evaluation and Results**

* Compare the performance of different models.
* Select the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics.
* Analyze the model's predictions and identify potential areas for improvement.

**Tools and Technologies**

* **Python:** Programming language.
* **Pandas, NumPy:** Data manipulation and analysis libraries.
* **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning library.
* **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** Data visualization libraries.

**Future Work**

* **Feature Engineering:** Explore creating new features (e.g., volume, density) to potentially improve model accuracy.
* **Advanced Techniques:** Investigate more advanced techniques such as deep learning or ensemble methods.
* **Deploy the Model:** Deploy the trained model for real-time price prediction.

This README provides a high-level overview of the project. You can further enhance it by:

* Adding more specific details about the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.
* Including visualizations of the data and model performance.
* Providing links to the code and datasets.
* Documenting the specific models used and their hyperparameters.

I hope this README provides a good starting point for your Gemstone Price Prediction project!
